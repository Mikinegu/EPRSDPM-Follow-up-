⚙️ Tech Stack

Next.js 14 (App Router)

Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI

TypeScript (optional but preferred)

Use Next.js API routes for backend logic

Use SQLite (via Prisma) or a local JSON file for lightweight data storage

When a site is chosen:

Automatically load:

Number of Staff

Staff list for that site

DL list for that site

(Use mock data for now, e.g., stored in /data/sites.json.)

👥 Staff Attendance

Each name is a modern button when clicked the background will be green and it should be toggled green for present and normal color for absent

Show total staff count and total present.
